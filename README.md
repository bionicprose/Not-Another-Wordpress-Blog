# Not-Another-Wordpress-Blog

This is a simple blogging website app using the Express framework on a NodeJS server. It features a limited WYSIWYG editor, comment system, and facebook/google authentication. Users, comments, and blog posts are stored and served from MongoDB using Mongoose. Users are authenticated through Passport. Blog posts and comments are rendered with Pug templates and mixins. Because this was designed as a learning project for Javascript, CSS, and HTML, this app *currently* makes no use of the popular frameworks or libraries.
